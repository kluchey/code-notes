Eg. (4)(5) in code is not multiplication. |\n| Division | / or // | \"/\" is normal division; \"//\" will always return an integer. |\n| Exponentiation | ** | \"2\\*\\*3\" will return 8 |\n| Brackets | () | For order of operations, only () are used. |\n| Equality | == | Will output `True` or `False` |\n| Variables | `x` or `phrase` | Eg. `Force = mass*acceleration` contains 3 variables |\n| Substitution or Value Setting | = | Eg. `mass=3` will set the variable `mass` to the value 3. |\n| Comments | # | To write words in your code that are not read by a computer, begin a line with #|\n\n**Note**:  Mathematics typically uses Real Numbers (ℝ). Coding is best used with Integers (ℤ) because real numbers, called *Floating Point Numbers* in coding are imprecise.\n\nTry using some of the operations above. You should also try 0.1 + 0.2 in the code space below to see how, um, weird it is; **be aware of this weirdness** with real numbers but don't worry too much about it for our purposes.\n\nUse `CTRL+Enter` or `Shift+Enter` when in a code space to run the code.",

If we assign it to a variable such as `xhat = np.array([1,0])` now we can use `xhat` to refer to (1, 0) which can be very handy. You try:\n\n## Task 2:  Vector Addition & Subtraction\n\n1. Write on one line `xhat = np.array([1,0])`.\n2. On a second line, define `yhat` as (0, 1)... you figure out the code.\n3. Set the variable `birthDay` to the day's number you were born. Set the variable `birthMonth` to the number month you were born.\n4. Can you predict what the vector `birthDay*xhat + birthMonth*yhat` will look like in (x, y) notation? What will it look like once you run its code?\n5. Can you modify your code to check if this vector math is true? 2(3,4)-6(-2,1) = (-6, 2)",

Note: **Python always starts its counting at 0, so the list 0, 1, 2, 3 is a list of the first 4 numbers**.\n\nRun the next code segment and answer the following questions:\n\n1. What do you think the function `print()` is doing in this code? (Run the code, analyse the output)\n2. How many times does this loop run?\n3. The output is a table of values. Can you tell what type of pattern was generated using vectors?\n4. How was this pattern generated using vectors? Why does it make sense that this pattern is that type?",
